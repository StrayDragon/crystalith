# LLMAN SDD Propose

Create a new change and generate all planning artifacts in one pass (proposal + delta specs + tasks; design optional), then validate and suggest next actions.

## Steps

1. Assess change scale (triage):
   - **Behavioural contract change** (modify MUST/SHALL, change external behaviour) → full SDD workflow
   - **Implementation change** (refactor, typo, perf) → quick path via `llman-sdd-quick`
   - **Meta-spec change** (SDD templates/process) → full SDD workflow
   - When uncertain, choose full SDD (conservative).
2. Use `llman sdd context --task "<goal>" --paths "<scope>"` to find relevant specs.
   - If context unavailable, rebuild with `llman sdd index rebuild` (default `pageindex`, no model needed) and continue.
3. Gather input:
   - A short description of the change
   - A change id (or derive one; kebab-case, verb prefix: `add-`, `update-`, `remove-`, `refactor-`)
   - The impacted capability/capabilities (to name `specs/<capability>/`)
   - Confirm the final id before writing files
4. Ensure the project is initialized:
   - `llmanspec/` must exist; if missing, tell the user to run `llman sdd init`, then STOP.
5. Create `llmanspec/changes/<change-id>/` and `llmanspec/changes/<change-id>/specs/`.
   - If the change already exists, STOP and suggest `llman-sdd-continue`.
6. Create artifacts under `llmanspec/changes/<change-id>/`:
   - `proposal.md` (Why / What Changes / Capabilities / Impact)
   - `specs/<capability>/spec.toon` for each capability (a standalone TOON document, one per file):
     - Prefer generating via authoring helpers so the TOON payload is well-formed:
       - `llman sdd delta skeleton <change-id> <capability>`
       - `llman sdd delta add-op ...`
       - `llman sdd delta add-scenario ...`
     - Include at least one `add_requirement`/`modify_requirement` op (statement MUST contain MUST/SHALL) and at least one matching op scenario row
   - `design.md` only when tradeoffs/migrations matter
   - `tasks.md` as an ordered checklist (include validation commands)
7. Validate:
   ```bash
   llman sdd validate <change-id> --strict --no-interactive
   ```
   This MUST pass before proceeding. If TOON parse errors appear, fix quoting:
   values containing commas/colons/brackets must be double-quoted in tabular rows.
8. Summarize what was created and suggest `llman-sdd-apply` for implementation.

Before acting, read `llmanspec/config.yaml` and follow its `context` and `rules` if present.

Common commands:

- `llman sdd context --task "<description>" --paths "<files>"` (find relevant specs). Uses the pageindex agentic tree backend (needs `LLMAN_SDD_INDEX_CHAT_MODEL`). Preset via `LLMAN_SDD_INDEX_BACKEND`.
- `llman sdd list` (list changes)
- `llman sdd list --specs` (list specs with purpose/scope metadata)
- `llman sdd show <id>` (show change/spec)
- `llman sdd validate <id>` (validate a change or spec)
- `llman sdd validate --all` (bulk validate)
- `llman sdd index rebuild` (rebuild the pageindex tree index — no model needed)
- `llman sdd index check` (check index freshness)
- `llman sdd archive run <id>` (archive a change)
- `llman sdd archive freeze [--before YYYY-MM-DD] [--keep-recent N] [--dry-run]` (freeze archived dirs)
- `llman sdd archive thaw [--change <id> ...] [--dest <path>]` (restore from cold-backup)
- `llman sdd graph [CHANGE] [--format mermaid] [--scope active|archived|all] [--depth N]` (generate change dependency graph)

Validation fixes (TOON standalone specs):

1. Missing validation scope (`Spec valid_scope must not be empty`):
   Main specs MUST carry a non-empty `valid_scope` inside the `.toon` document.
   `llmanspec/specs/<feature-id>/spec.toon`:

```toon
kind: llman.sdd.spec
name: sample
purpose: "One-line overview."
valid_scope[1]: src
requirements[1]{req_id,title,statement}:
  r1,Title,System MUST do something.
scenarios[1]{req_id,id,given,when,then}:
  r1,happy,"",a trigger happens,the outcome is observed
```

2. No delta ops in a change: add at least one op + scenario in
   `llmanspec/changes/<change-id>/specs/<feature-id>/spec.toon`:

```toon
kind: llman.sdd.delta
ops[1]{op,req_id,title,statement,from,to,name}:
  add_requirement,r1,Title,System MUST do something.,null,null,null
op_scenarios[1]{req_id,id,given,when,then}:
  r1,happy,"",a trigger happens,the outcome is observed
```

3. Tabular value quoting error ("Expected N tabular row values, but got M"):
   Values containing **spaces**, commas, colons, or brackets MUST be double-quoted in tabular rows.

```toon
# BAD: spaces in an unquoted value split it into multiple values
r1,happy,"",a trigger happens,the outcome is observed

# GOOD: multi-word values quoted
r1,happy,"","a trigger happens","the outcome is observed"
```

4. BDD empty spec guardrail (`BDD is enabled but this spec declares no requirements and no feature_refs`):
   When `config.yaml` has a `bdd` block, a spec must either declare `requirements`, or point to a `.feature` via `feature_refs` (point-only mode).

Notes:

- Each spec is a single standalone `.toon` file; there is no Markdown shell or ```toon fence.
- `null` represents missing optional fields.
- Migrate legacy `.md`+fence specs with `llman sdd migrate`.

## Context

- Gather the current change/spec state before acting.
- Prefer `llman sdd context --task --paths` to discover relevant specs instead of guessing or full scans.

## Goal

- State the concrete outcome for this command/skill execution.

## Constraints

- Keep changes minimal and scoped.
- Avoid guessing when identifiers or intent are ambiguous.
- Use `llman sdd context --task --paths` before reading full spec files.
- Choose workflow path based on change scale: behavioral contract changes use full SDD, implementation changes use quick path.

## Workflow

- Use `llman sdd` commands as the source of truth.
- Validate outcomes when files or specs are updated.
- Prefer `llman sdd context` over full reads or guessing.
- When context is unavailable follow error guidance (rebuild index or fall back to `list --specs --json`).

## Decision Policy

- Ask for clarification when a high-impact ambiguity remains.
- Stop instead of forcing through known validation errors.

## Output Contract

- Summarize actions taken.
- Provide resulting paths and validation status.

## Ethics Governance

- `ethics.risk_level`: classify risk as `low|medium|high|critical`.
- `ethics.prohibited_actions`: list actions that MUST NOT be performed.
- `ethics.required_evidence`: list required evidence before high-impact output.
- `ethics.refusal_contract`: define when to refuse and safe alternative response.
- `ethics.escalation_policy`: define when to escalate to user confirmation/review.

## Future-to-Execution Planning

- Treat `llmanspec/changes/<id>/future.md` as a candidate backlog, not passive notes.
- Review `Deferred Items`, `Branch Options`, and `Triggers to Reopen`; classify each item as:
  - `now` (must be converted into executable work now)
  - `later` (keep in future.md with explicit trigger/signal)
  - `drop` (remove or mark rejected with rationale)
- For each `now` item, propose a concrete landing path:
  - follow-up change id (`add-...`, `update-...`, `refactor-...`)
  - affected capability/spec path
  - first executable action (`llman-sdd-propose`, `llman-sdd-new-change`, `llman-sdd-continue`, `llman-sdd-ff`, or `llman-sdd-apply`)
- Keep traceability: reference source future item in the new proposal/design/tasks notes.
- When uncertainty is high, pause and ask before creating new change artifacts.
