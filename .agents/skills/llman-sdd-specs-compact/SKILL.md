# LLMAN SDD Specs Compact

Use this skill to reduce specs bloat while preserving MUST/Scenario behavior.

## Context
- Specs can grow and duplicate requirements across capabilities.
- Compaction must preserve behavior and testability.
- Large archive history can add noise during consolidation and review.

## Goal
- Identify redundant requirement/scenario text.
- Produce a compact structure with clear retained canonical requirements.

## Constraints
- Never remove normative behavior without explicit replacement.
- Keep requirement headers stable when possible.
- Every retained requirement must keep at least one valid scenario.

## Workflow
1. Inventory current specs (`llman sdd list --specs`).
2. If archived change history is large, run archive freeze first:
   - preview: `llman sdd archive freeze --dry-run`
   - execute: `llman sdd archive freeze --before <YYYY-MM-DD> --keep-recent <N>`
3. Map overlap candidates across capabilities.
4. Propose a compaction plan (canonical requirements + keep/merge/remove decisions + migration notes).
5. Validate impacted specs (`llman sdd validate --specs --strict --no-interactive`).

## Decision Policy
- Prefer deduplication when two requirements are semantically equivalent.
- Prefer extraction into shared capability text only when references remain clear.
- Recommend archive freeze before compaction when archived directories are noisy.
- Stop and ask when compaction would alter external behavior.

## Output Contract
- Provide a compacting plan grouped by capability.
- Include: keep/merge/remove decisions and rationale.
- Include validation commands and expected outcomes.

Before acting, read `llmanspec/config.yaml` and follow its `context` and `rules` if present.

Common commands:
- `llman sdd context --task "<description>" --paths "<files>"` (find relevant specs). Uses the pageindex agentic tree backend (needs `LLMAN_SDD_INDEX_CHAT_MODEL`). Preset via `LLMAN_SDD_INDEX_BACKEND`.
- `llman sdd list` (list changes)
- `llman sdd list --specs` (list specs with purpose/scope metadata)
- `llman sdd show <id>` (show change/spec)
- `llman sdd validate <id>` (validate a change or spec)
- `llman sdd validate --all` (bulk validate)
- `llman sdd index rebuild` (rebuild the pageindex tree index — no model needed)
- `llman sdd index check` (check index freshness)
- `llman sdd archive run <id>` (archive a change)
- `llman sdd archive freeze [--before YYYY-MM-DD] [--keep-recent N] [--dry-run]` (freeze archived dirs)
- `llman sdd archive thaw [--change <id> ...] [--dest <path>]` (restore from cold-backup)
- `llman sdd graph [CHANGE] [--format mermaid] [--scope active|archived|all] [--depth N]` (generate change dependency graph)


Validation fixes (TOON standalone specs):

1) Missing validation scope (`Spec valid_scope must not be empty`):
Main specs MUST carry a non-empty `valid_scope` inside the `.toon` document.
`llmanspec/specs/<feature-id>/spec.toon`:
```toon
kind: llman.sdd.spec
name: sample
purpose: "One-line overview."
valid_scope[1]: src
requirements[1]{req_id,title,statement}:
  r1,Title,System MUST do something.
scenarios[1]{req_id,id,given,when,then}:
  r1,happy,"",a trigger happens,the outcome is observed
```

2) No delta ops in a change: add at least one op + scenario in
`llmanspec/changes/<change-id>/specs/<feature-id>/spec.toon`:
```toon
kind: llman.sdd.delta
ops[1]{op,req_id,title,statement,from,to,name}:
  add_requirement,r1,Title,System MUST do something.,null,null,null
op_scenarios[1]{req_id,id,given,when,then}:
  r1,happy,"",a trigger happens,the outcome is observed
```

3) Tabular value quoting error ("Expected N tabular row values, but got M"):
Values containing **spaces**, commas, colons, or brackets MUST be double-quoted in tabular rows.
```toon
# BAD: spaces in an unquoted value split it into multiple values
r1,happy,"",a trigger happens,the outcome is observed

# GOOD: multi-word values quoted
r1,happy,"","a trigger happens","the outcome is observed"
```

4) BDD empty spec guardrail (`BDD is enabled but this spec declares no requirements and no feature_refs`):
When `config.yaml` has a `bdd` block, a spec must either declare `requirements`, or point to a `.feature` via `feature_refs` (point-only mode).

Notes:
- Each spec is a single standalone `.toon` file; there is no Markdown shell or ```toon fence.
- `null` represents missing optional fields.
- Migrate legacy `.md`+fence specs with `llman sdd migrate`.


## Context
- Gather the current change/spec state before acting.
- Prefer `llman sdd context --task --paths` to discover relevant specs instead of guessing or full scans.

## Goal
- State the concrete outcome for this command/skill execution.

## Constraints
- Keep changes minimal and scoped.
- Avoid guessing when identifiers or intent are ambiguous.
- Use `llman sdd context --task --paths` before reading full spec files.
- Choose workflow path based on change scale: behavioral contract changes use full SDD, implementation changes use quick path.

## Workflow
- Use `llman sdd` commands as the source of truth.
- Validate outcomes when files or specs are updated.
- Prefer `llman sdd context` over full reads or guessing.
- When context is unavailable follow error guidance (rebuild index or fall back to `list --specs --json`).

## Decision Policy
- Ask for clarification when a high-impact ambiguity remains.
- Stop instead of forcing through known validation errors.

## Output Contract
- Summarize actions taken.
- Provide resulting paths and validation status.

## Ethics Governance
- `ethics.risk_level`: classify risk as `low|medium|high|critical`.
- `ethics.prohibited_actions`: list actions that MUST NOT be performed.
- `ethics.required_evidence`: list required evidence before high-impact output.
- `ethics.refusal_contract`: define when to refuse and safe alternative response.
- `ethics.escalation_policy`: define when to escalate to user confirmation/review.
